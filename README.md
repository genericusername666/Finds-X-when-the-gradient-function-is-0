Finds X when gradient-function = 0 
(or at least roughly 0)
HOW TO USE PROGRAM
=======================================

A simple program that calculates X when the gradient function is equal to (or close enough to) 0

You will have to MANUALLY plug in the equation to the program
All the rest (the setp, degree of accuracy, etc...) can be configured through the interface
